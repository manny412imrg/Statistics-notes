Where data come from and why that’s so important
Different Types of Data
Two key types of data
-	Organic / Process Data
Examples of financial or Point-of-sale transactions / Stock market exchanges
	Web browser activity
	Netflix viewing history
	Sporting events
	Temperature/pollution 
These processes generate massive quantities of data -> “Big Data”
Processing requires significant computational recourses; data scientists “mine” these data to study trends and uncover interesting relationships
-	“Designed” Data Collection
Designed to specifically address a stated research objective
Individuals sampled from a population, interviewed about opinions on a particular topic.
“Designed” Data Collection
	Common features of “designed” data
Sampling from population, administration of carefully designed question
Typically data ser much smaller compared to organic/process data set.
Data collected for very specific reasons, rather than simple reflections of ongoing natural process.
For analyzing data, regardless of sources, an important question:
Are the Data independent and identically distributed?
What if Data are NOT I.i.d.?
Quantitative Variables
Numerical, measurable quantities in which arithmetic operations often make sense.
•	Continuous – could take on any value within an interval, many possible values
•	Discrete – countable values, finite number of balues
Categorical (or Qualitative) Variables
•	Classifies individuals or items into different groups
Confirmatory vs Exploratory Research
Confirmatory: Scientific method – specify falsifiable hypothesis, then test it -> collect and analyze data without first pre-specifying question
CAUTION: Informative but watch out for “overfitting” , “multiple testing” “p-hacking”
The more question you sak from a dataset -> the more likely you are to draw a misleading conclusion.
